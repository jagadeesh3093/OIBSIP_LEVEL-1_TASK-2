    <p style="font-size: 30px;"> The MIND COLORS is a must-have game for all intellectual kids who like to accept 
        difficult challenges. It is a game that requires two people to engage in a battle of 
        wits. Whoever is smarter amongst the competitors, wins the game. This game meant 
        for two players, requires one person to create codes and the other one to crack that 
        code. Both of them have to constantly make use of logic and wit to make sure that 
        they do not let the other person win the code cracking game. </p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px;"> One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker.The codemaker 
        chooses a pattern of three color code. Players decide in advance whether duplicates 
        and blanks are allowed. If so, the codemaker may even choose four same-colored 
        code. The codemaker places the chosen pattern in the three holes covered by the 
        shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker. 
         The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within Ten 
        turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of color code on the decoding board.Once 
        placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing black and white colors in the 
        small holes of the row with the guess. A black colored code is placed for each color 
        code from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white color code 
        indicates the existence of a correct color code placed in the wrong position . Based 
        on number of guesses made the score is decided. if 5th guess is correct code then 
        score will be 50.
